The makefile "all" command produces a single final executable called digitcompress

Usage: ./digitcompress -c textToEncode.txt
Running this command in the terminal will generate a .bin file according to the assignment's instructions

Usage: ./digitcompress -d binaryToDecode.bin
Running this command in the terminal will generate a .txt file according to the assignment's instructions

Note : textToEncode.txt and binaryToDecode.bin could be replaced with any text or binary
files respectively, assuming they check the conditions for the assignment
(Only digits 0 to 9 in text, and the fitting conditions for binary)
